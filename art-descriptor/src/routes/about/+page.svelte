  <p>Parkstrasse 44 is ongoing and consists of several parts, each of which influencing its meaning, application and materiality. The family house, captured onto a photograph by my great grandfather, was bombed as the result of a war:
    signifying a lived experience and a place in geography. I was interested in the act of meaning making through reworking, reconfiguring and reproducing copies of this image in various forms. Throughout material focussed processes I developed ideas around the
    ephemeral, corruptive and fleeting quality of memory, meaning and its objects.</p>
